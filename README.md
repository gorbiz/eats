Eats
====

Eats is a simple recipe manager that runs in the browser.

All of the code for this application is written as Literate CoffeeScript. This means the source files are essentially Markdown files with CoffeeScript code embedded in them. This means you can read through the code almost as if it were a book. There are even links between related components. You can start from the [entry point][ep] of the application or just view any of the .litcoffee files in the repository.

[ep]: client/js/main.litcoffee
